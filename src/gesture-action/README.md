This A-Frame Gestures is taken from [AR.js Gestures](https://github.com/fcor/arjs-gestures).

A-Frame Gestures for Mind AR TS. This work is based on [AR.js Gestures](https://github.com/fcor/arjs-gestures) from @fcor and [this example](https://github.com/8thwall/web/blob/master/examples/aframe/manipulate/README.md) from 8th Wall.

Scale and rotate 3D elements from your Mind AR TS scene using `gesture-detector` and `gesture-handler` components. There is a mouse counterpart for the gesture
so the gesture work on both touch and mouse.
